# Mobile 1-D Face Liveness Detection Dataset

The dataset was created with the goal of evaluating models for **liveness detection on the fly, based on photoplethysmography (rPPG) estimated pulses**.  It simulates a setting where a liveness verification step is conducted during an user authentication phase in a mobile phone. To keep the application responsive, liveness needs to be detected on an atmost 5s video, in a non-intrusive manner.
